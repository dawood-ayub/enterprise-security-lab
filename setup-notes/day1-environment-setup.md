# Day 1 – Environment & Architecture Setup

## Objectives
- Design an enterprise-style cybersecurity lab
- Define network segmentation and attack paths
- Identify log sources for centralized monitoring

## Key Decisions
- Active Directory used to simulate identity-based attacks
- Centralized SIEM implemented for visibility and detection
- Separate attacker system to model external threat behavior

## Outcomes
- Architecture diagram created
- Systems identified and scoped
- Logging strategy defined for future detection use cases
